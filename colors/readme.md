# Adding Applications

These color scheme files are generated using the Base16 Builder and a helper
script.

## Setup

Get the Base16 Builder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder ~/.config/base16-builder
```

## Running

* Modify the `current.yml` file to reflect the color scheme you want.
* Run the `colors_generator.sh` script
* Vim's colorscheme should be automatically updated
* Update your `~/.Xresources` file with the current.*.xresources file of your
    choosing (dark/light)
* Update the bar colors and dmenu calls to match

## TODO

Automate the whole thing so it's super easy to swap entire color schemes
"instantly".
